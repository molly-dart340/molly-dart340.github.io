                <li>In a large bowl, combine fresh and thawed strawberries. Cover and refrigerate until serving.</li>
                <li>Line an 8-in. round cake pan with plastic wrap, letting edges hang over sides; set aside. In a large
                    bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In a small bowl, stir together 1-1/2 cups cream
                    and
                    vanilla. Stir into flour mixture just until moistened. Transfer to prepared pan; pat into an even
                    layer.
                    Cover and freeze 45 minutes or until slightly firm. Preheat oven to 425°.</li>
                <li>Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Cut into 8 wedges. Place wedges on a parchment-lined
                    baking
                    sheet. Brush with 1 tablespoon whipping cream and, if desired, sprinkle with additional sugar. Bake
                    until golden brown, 15-18 minutes. </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine remaining whipping cream and confectioners' sugar; whip until stiff peaks form.
                    To
                    serve, cut scones in half; top with reserved strawberries and whipped cream. Garnish as desired.

                <h4>Can you substitute milk for cream in this scone recipe with cream and strawberries? </h4></b>
                <h5>Scone recipes typically call for some sort of dairy, such as cream, milk, buttermilk and yogurt. So you can make a swap for a different dairy ingredient, including milk for cream. The scones won’t be as rich, and you may see a texture difference, but the recipe will still work. If you’re looking to go dairy-free entirely, you will have to make a few more adjustments. </h5>
                <br>
                <h4>What are some variations of this recipe? </h4>
                <h5>Scones are an ideal base for mix-ins and are incredibly flexible. Use a different fresh fruit—blueberries are classic, as are peaches. Or, you can use dried fruits, such as raisins or currants, or dried cherries, cranberries or apricots. Flavored chips, like miniature chocolate chips or cinnamon chips, make a fun twist, too. Try topping your scones with a dusting of cinnamon-sugar or make a simple vanilla glaze. But scones don’t have to be sweet! They adapt beautifully to savory options: finely chopped ham or prosciutto, or herbs, such as rosemary, chives, and thyme. You can mix in cheeses—from cheddar and Monterey jack to parmesan and Romano. As a general rule, add moist ingredients with the wet ingredients, and dry with the dry. </h5>
                <br>
                <h4>Can you make this scone recipe with cream and strawberries ahead of time?</h4>
                <h5>If you’re looking to get a jump start on a brunch get-together, you can prepare these scones ahead of time. Make the dough and shape the scones, then place them on a baking sheet and freeze them. Once frozen, transfer them to an airtight container and keep in the freezer for up to a week. You can bake them without thawing them first—just add another 5-7 minutes of baking time. </h5>
